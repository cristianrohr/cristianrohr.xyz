A cellular automaton is a model of a system of “cell” objects with the following characteristics.


  * The cells live on a grid. (We’ll see examples in both one and two dimensions in this chapter, though a cellular automaton can exist in any finite number of dimensions.)

  * Each cell has a state. The number of state possibilities is typically finite. The simplest example has the two possibilities of 1 and 0 (otherwise referred to as “on” and “off” or “alive” and “dead”).

  * Each cell has a neighborhood. This can be defined in any number of ways, but it is typically a list of adjacent cells.

Cellular automata were invented in the late 1940s by Stanislaw Ulam (1909-1984) and John von Neumann (1903-1957). One can say that the "cellular" part comes from Ulam, and the "automata" part from von Neumann.
