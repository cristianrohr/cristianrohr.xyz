      <description>In Argentina there is a very young and talented music producer called BIZARRAP.
He is very famous for the BZRP Music Sessions, which are tracks in collaboration with international artists that Bizarrap produces in his studio, which also serves as a recording studio for the official video clip of the track.
In these sessions the artists have the freedom to express themselves in ways that perhaps the industry doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow them because they have an image to sell, or the freedom to deliver whatever they want.</description>

      <description>This came from my background in bioinformatics. The theory behind this, and the use of WEBGL remainds me the molecular structures of proteins.</description>

      <description>A cellular automaton is a model of a system of “cell” objects with the following characteristics.
The cells live on a grid. (We’ll see examples in both one and two dimensions in this chapter, though a cellular automaton can exist in any finite number of dimensions.)
Each cell has a state. The number of state possibilities is typically finite. The simplest example has the two possibilities of 1 and 0 (otherwise referred to as “on” and “off” or “alive” and “dead”).</description>
