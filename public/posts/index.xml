      <description>In Argentina there is a very young and talented music producer called BIZARRAP.
He is very famous for the BZRP Music Sessions, which are tracks in collaboration with international artists that Bizarrap produces in his studio, which also serves as a recording studio for the official video clip of the track.
In these sessions the artists have the freedom to express themselves in ways that perhaps the industry doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow them because they have an image to sell, or the freedom to deliver whatever they want.</description>
